# Junior Data Scientist
Public-facing CaRMS data scraped from the CaRMS website.

We are modernizing our infrastructure using PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy/SQLModel, Dagster, LangChain, and FastAPI. Use the data in this repository to show us your data engineering, data science, and/or visualization skills. Use our stack to show us what you can do! Build something, provide your project GitHub repository link in the your application to the Junior Data Scientist position in our group, get an interview, and present your work to us.

A sample project using our stack with a containerized approach, particularly on AWS will get our attention.
